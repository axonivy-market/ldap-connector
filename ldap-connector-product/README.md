# Active Directory Connector

**Active Directory (AD)** is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks, which provides centralized management and authentication of users, computers, and other resources within the network. It uses the **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)** as its underlying protocol to query and manage directory information. LDAP is the standard protocol that AD employs to authenticate and authorize users and resources within a network.
